notes: 'Identify recurrent human decisions that should become policy —

  where humans are acting as rate limiters instead of governance.


  What it shows:

  - Repeated decision patterns (same condition, same outcome, same actors)

  - Frequency × avoided effort × avoided cost ranking

  - Cost-overrun overrides approved repeatedly

  - Manual allowlist decisions trending up

  - Direct links to Policies → Drafts and Limits → Thresholds (pre-filled context)


  What it explicitly does NOT show:

  - No execution or approval actions

  - No policy editing

  - No incident details'
