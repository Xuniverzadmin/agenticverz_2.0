notes: 'Show incident prevention and regulation impact — what policies are preventing
  or shaping.


  What it shows:

  - Incidents prevented entirely

  - Incidents soft-regulated (slowed, capped, gated)

  - Incidents escalated to human decision

  - Policy → incident class mapping

  - Evidence-backed only (claimed prevention without observation ignored)


  What it explicitly does NOT show:

  - No policy changes

  - No enforcement controls

  - No draft proposals'
