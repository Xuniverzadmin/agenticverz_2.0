notes: 'Show override and fracture analysis — which violations were ignored or softened.


  What it shows:

  - Override count, override rate (% of violations)

  - Fracture duration (avg/p95), re-entry success rate

  - Breakdown: by role, by policy, by urgency tag

  - Flags: repeated overrides on same policy, overrides followed by failure


  What it explicitly does NOT show:

  - No override controls

  - No policy editing'
