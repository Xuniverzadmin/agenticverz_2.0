notes: 'Show loss and impact quantification — what violations actually cost.


  What it shows:

  - Cost lost, time lost (compute + human wait), productivity lost

  - Cost saved (from enforced blocks)

  - Views: by LLM, by agent, by human, by policy, by time window

  - Saved and lost shown together (no vanity metrics)


  What it explicitly does NOT show:

  - No policy controls

  - No threshold editing'
