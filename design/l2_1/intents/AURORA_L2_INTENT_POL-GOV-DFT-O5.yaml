notes: 'Show decision outcomes and lifecycle routing after human decides.


  What it shows:

  - Approved: draft → active policy, moves to Governance → Active

  - Rejected: draft archived with reason, signal suppressed

  - Deferred: parked for more data, re-evaluated later

  - Every draft must end in one of these three states


  What it explicitly does NOT show:

  - No silent expiration

  - No auto-decisions'
