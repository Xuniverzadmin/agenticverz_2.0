notes: 'Show cost and performance side effects — what governance is costing us.


  What it shows:

  - Cost saved by enforcement

  - Cost introduced by enforcement (latency, friction, rejects)

  - Trade-offs: safety vs throughput, cost vs success rate, automation vs human load

  - Numbers only, no value judgment


  What it explicitly does NOT show:

  - No policy tuning controls

  - No recommendations

  - No forecasts'
