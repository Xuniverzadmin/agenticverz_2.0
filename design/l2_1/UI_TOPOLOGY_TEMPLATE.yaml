# UI TOPOLOGY TEMPLATE
# Status: FROZEN - DO NOT EDIT WITHOUT GOVERNANCE APPROVAL
# Authority: Human (PIN-419)
# Purpose: Defines the ONLY allowed UI structure. Panels must occupy slots within this topology.
#
# This file defines WHERE panels may exist, not WHAT they contain.
# The Intent Ledger occupies slots. The generator validates against this template.
#
# Invariants:
#   - Domains, subdomains, topics are exhaustive (no additions without governance)
#   - panel_slots defines max panels per topic (1-4)
#   - Slot numbers are 1-indexed (Slot 1, Slot 2, etc.)
#   - Any panel outside this topology is rejected by coherency gate
