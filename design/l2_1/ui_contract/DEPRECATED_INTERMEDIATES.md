# Deprecated Intermediate Artifacts

**Status:** PARTIAL DEPRECATION
**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Reference:** `design/l2_1/AURORA_L2.md`, PIN-370

---

## Canonical File (ACTIVE)

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `ui_projection_lock.json` | **CANONICAL** | Current UI projection (generated by AURORA L2 compiler) |

## Deprecated Intermediates (DO NOT USE)

The following files were generated by the **LEGACY CSV pipeline** and are no longer updated:

| File | Status | Legacy Purpose |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `ui_intent_ir_raw.json` | DEPRECATED | Output of l2_raw_intent_parser.py |
| `ui_intent_ir_normalized.json` | DEPRECATED | Output of intent_normalizer.py |
| `ui_intent_ir_slotted.json` | DEPRECATED | Output of surface_to_slot_resolver.py |
| `ui_intent_ir_compiled.json` | DEPRECATED | Output of intent_compiler.py |
| `ui_contract_v1_summary.md` | DEPRECATED | Human-readable summary |

## Current Pipeline

The AURORA L2 pipeline generates `ui_projection_lock.json` directly from:
- Intent YAMLs (`design/l2_1/intents/*.yaml`)
- Capability Registry (`backend/AURORA_L2_CAPABILITY_REGISTRY/*.yaml`)

There are no intermediate JSON stages in the current pipeline.

## Why These Files Still Exist

These files are preserved for:
1. Historical reference during migration validation
2. Rollback capability if AURORA L2 compiler fails
3. Audit trail of previous pipeline outputs

## Cleanup Plan

These files may be deleted after:
- [ ] AURORA L2 pipeline is fully validated
- [ ] No rollback is needed
- [ ] Explicit approval to delete

**Do not reference these intermediate files in new code.**
