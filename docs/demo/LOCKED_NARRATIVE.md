# AI Incident Console - Locked Narrative

**Status: FROZEN - Do Not Modify**

---

## The One-Paragraph Pitch

> **"AI Incident Console is an investigation and prevention system for AI-powered products. When an AI system produces a harmful or incorrect output, the console reconstructs exactly what happened, explains why it happened, and proves whether existing safeguards would have prevented it — all in minutes."**

---

## Target Customer Profile

- **Company**: B2B SaaS
- **Stage**: AI in production
- **Size**: <50 people
- **Key Qualifier**: Has experienced at least one AI embarrassment already

## The Problem (What We Solve)

When your AI screws up:

1. **You can't explain what happened** - Logs are scattered, context is lost
2. **You can't prove you tried to prevent it** - No audit trail
3. **You can't show due diligence** - Legal asks, you shrug
4. **You can't prevent it next time** - No systematic approach

## The Solution (What We Do)

The AI Incident Console provides:

| Capability | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Reconstruction** | Exact timeline of what happened, step by step |
| **Explanation** | Machine-derived root cause, not guesswork |
| **Verification** | Cryptographically verifiable replay |
| **Prevention Proof** | "Would have prevented" counterfactual |
| **Evidence Export** | Legal-grade PDF for audit/compliance |

## The Pitch Line

> **"When your AI screws up, can you explain what happened — and prove how you fixed it?"**

Do not explain the technology.
Run the demo.
Say nothing else.
