## Signal Tracking (Tally marks)

### P0 - HARD FAILS (2+ = stop beta)

|--------|-------|----------------|
| "Why did this run do that?" (after O3) | | |
| "Why did it cost more?" (after badge) | | |
| "Was memory used?" (after PRE-RUN) | | |
| "Did policy block this?" (after CONSTRAINTS) | | |
| Repeated back/forth navigation | | |
| "Where do I see that?" | | |
| "This feels like it's hiding something" | | |

### PASS Signals (Good signs)
