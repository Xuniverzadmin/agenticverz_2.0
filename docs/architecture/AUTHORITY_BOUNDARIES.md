# Authority Boundaries

**Status:** DECLARED
**Generated:** 2025-12-31
**Purpose:** Declare who may decide intent for each layer
**Reference:** PIN-253 (Layer Flow Coherency Verification)

---

## Purpose

This document does not declare design intent.
It declares **who is authorized to decide intent later**.

This prevents future confusion about ownership when:
- Promoting STATIC verification to SEMANTIC
- Resolving ambiguous dependencies
- Making architectural decisions about layer flows

---

## Authority Map

| Layer | Name | Intent Authority | Decision Scope |
|-------|------|------------------|----------------|
| L7 | Ops & Deployment | Ops / Reliability | Systemd services, schedulers, maintenance jobs |
| L6 | Platform Substrate | Platform | DB schemas, Redis, external service integrations |
| L5 | Execution & Workers | Execution / Runtime | Background jobs, worker behavior, run lifecycle |
| L4 | Domain Engines | Domain / Product | Business rules, service contracts |
| L3 | Boundary Adapters | Platform | Thin translation layers |
| L2 | Product APIs | Product | REST endpoint behavior |
| L1 | Product Experience | Product | UI/UX decisions |
| L8 | Catalyst / Meta | Engineering | CI, tests, validators |

---

## Decision Rights

### L7 (Ops) Intent Decisions

The Ops/Reliability function decides:
- Whether a job should exist
- What triggers it (timer, event, manual)
- What L6 artifacts it may produce
- Recovery behavior and failure modes

### L6 (Platform) Intent Decisions

The Platform function decides:
- Schema structure and evolution
- Which artifacts are authoritative vs advisory
- Cross-service data contracts
- Persistence guarantees

### L5 (Runtime) Intent Decisions

The Execution/Runtime function decides:
- Worker concurrency and scaling
- Job execution semantics
- State machine transitions
- Capability gating behavior

### L4+ (Domain/Product) Intent Decisions

Reserved for future work. Domain intent decisions will be bound when L4 analysis begins.

---

## Usage

When a STATIC verification needs promotion to SEMANTIC:
1. Identify the layer of the artifact in question
2. Consult the authority for that layer
3. Authority confirms or denies intentional dependency
4. If confirmed, update verification status with authority reference
