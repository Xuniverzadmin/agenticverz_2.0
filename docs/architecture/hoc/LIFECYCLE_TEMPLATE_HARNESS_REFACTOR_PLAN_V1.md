# NOTE (Superseded)

This plan was split because **domain lifecycle harnessing** (tenant/env/policy/api_key state)
and **knowledge plane lifecycle** (onboarding→indexing→activation stage machine) are
different systems with different owners, invariants, and runtime call paths.

- Domain lifecycle harness plan: `docs/architecture/hoc/DOMAIN_LIFECYCLE_HARNESS_REFACTOR_PLAN_V1.md`
- Knowledge plane lifecycle plan: `docs/architecture/hoc/KNOWLEDGE_PLANE_LIFECYCLE_REFACTOR_PLAN_V1.md`
