## L7 Model Classification

Models fall into 3 buckets:
1. **System Invariant** — never move (tenant, base, audit)
2. **Domain-Owned** — eligible for domain models (human decision)
3. **Cross-Domain Fact** — shared, consumed by multiple domains

### System Invariant (0)

None.

### Domain Owned (0)

None.

### Cross Domain Fact (0)

None.
