## L7 Model Classification

Models fall into 3 buckets:
1. **System Invariant** — never move (tenant, base, audit)
2. **Domain-Owned** — eligible for domain models (human decision)
3. **Cross-Domain Fact** — shared, consumed by multiple domains

### System Invariant (2)

| Model | Domains Using | Drivers | Action |
|-------|---------------|---------|--------|
| `audit_ledger` | logs, overview | 5 | STAYS in app/models/ — system invariant |
| `tenant` | account, activity, analytics, api_keys, apis, integrations, overview, policies | 14 | STAYS in app/models/ — system invariant |

### Domain Owned (22)

| Model | Domains Using | Drivers | Action |
|-------|---------------|---------|--------|
| `alert_config` | none found | 0 | FLAG: no L6 driver references found — verify usage (human decision) |
| `contract` | none found | 0 | FLAG: no L6 driver references found — verify usage (human decision) |
| `export_bundles` | incidents | 1 | FLAG: domain-localized data candidate (human decision) |
| `governance` | none found | 0 | FLAG: no L6 driver references found — verify usage (human decision) |
| `governance_job` | none found | 0 | FLAG: no L6 driver references found — verify usage (human decision) |
| `knowledge_lifecycle` | none found | 0 | FLAG: no L6 driver references found — verify usage (human decision) |
| `threshold_signal` | none found | 0 | FLAG: no L6 driver references found — verify usage (human decision) |
| `policy_precedence` | policies | 1 | FLAG: domain-localized data candidate (human decision) |
| `policy_scope` | policies | 1 | FLAG: domain-localized data candidate (human decision) |
| `log_exports` | logs | 1 | FLAG: domain-localized data candidate (human decision) |
| `logs_records` | logs | 1 | FLAG: domain-localized data candidate (human decision) |
| `prediction` | analytics | 2 | FLAG: domain-localized data candidate (human decision) |

### Cross Domain Fact (6)

| Model | Domains Using | Drivers | Action |
|-------|---------------|---------|--------|
| `policy` | overview, policies | 4 | STAYS shared — cross-domain fact table |
| `cus_models` | activity, integrations, policies | 4 | STAYS shared — cross-domain fact table |
| `policy_control_plane` | controls, overview, policies | 9 | STAYS shared — cross-domain fact table |
| `costsim_cb` | analytics, controls | 3 | STAYS shared — cross-domain fact table |
