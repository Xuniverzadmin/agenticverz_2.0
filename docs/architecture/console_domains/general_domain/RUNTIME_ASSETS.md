# RUNTIME ASSETS (Non-Signal)

**Status:** VERIFIED
**Generated:** 2025-12-31
**Purpose:** Catalog of non-Python artifacts consumed at runtime that are NOT signals

---

## Definition Boundary

A **signal** is a runtime-generated artifact created or mutated as a result of execution.

A **runtime asset** is:
- Consumed at runtime (read, not produced)
- Does not create persisted artifacts
- Qualifies or configures behavior
- Static or infrequently updated

**Key distinction:** Signals are OUTPUTS. Assets are INPUTS.

---

## 1. Configuration Assets

| File | Purpose | Consumed By | Trigger |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `app/config/feature_flags.json` | Feature toggle matrix | `app.config.__init__.py` | Startup, hot-reload |
| `app/config/rbac_policies.json` | RBAC permission matrix | `app.auth.rbac_engine.py` | Auth middleware |

**Impact:** HIGH - incorrect config breaks authorization and feature gating.

**NOT signals because:** These are read, not produced. No persisted artifact created.

---

## 2. Validation Schemas

| File | Purpose | Validates |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `app/schemas/skill_metadata.schema.json` | Skill registration input | `app.skills.registry` |
| `app/schemas/structured_outcome.schema.json` | Skill execution output | `app.runtime.outcome` |
| `app/schemas/resource_contract.schema.json` | Resource budget declarations | `app.costsim` |
| `app/schemas/agent_profile.schema.json` | Agent registration input | `app.agents` |
| `app/schemas/failure_catalog.schema.json` | Failure catalog structure | `app.runtime.failure_catalog` |

**Impact:** HIGH - schema violations cause runtime validation errors.

**NOT signals because:** Validation is enforcement, not artifact creation. At most, validation produces errors (which may be signals if persisted, but the schema itself is not).

---

## 3. Skill Contracts

| File | Purpose | Defines |
|------|---------|---------|
| `app/skills/contracts/llm_invoke.contract.yaml` | LLM invoke skill interface | Input/output schema, permissions, side effects |
| `app/skills/contracts/http_call.contract.yaml` | HTTP call skill interface | Input/output schema, permissions, side effects |
| `app/skills/contracts/http_call.yaml` | HTTP call skill (alt) | Same as above |
| `app/skills/contracts/json_transform.contract.yaml` | JSON transform skill | Input/output schema, determinism |

**Impact:** HIGH - skill contracts define execution behavior.

**NOT signals because:** Loading a contract does not produce a runtime artifact. The contract is a definition.

---

## 4. Runtime Data

| File | Purpose | Note |
|------|---------|------|
| `app/data/failure_catalog.json` | Failure pattern definitions | **Source for SIG-206** |

**Special case:** This file IS the source for signal SIG-206 (FailureCatalogMatch).
The file itself is static data, but when `failure_catalog.match()` runs, a `failure_matches` record is persisted.

The **file** is a runtime asset. The **match result** is a signal.

---

## 5. Summary

| Category | Count | Signal? |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Configuration | 2 | NO |
| Validation Schemas | 5 | NO |
| Skill Contracts | 4 | NO |
| Runtime Data (signal source) | 1 | Indirect |
| **Total Runtime Assets** | **12** | |

---

## Governance

When adding new runtime assets:
1. Add to this document
2. Do NOT register as signals (unless they produce persisted artifacts)
3. Ensure validation exists for schema files
4. Ensure config files have reload mechanisms documented
