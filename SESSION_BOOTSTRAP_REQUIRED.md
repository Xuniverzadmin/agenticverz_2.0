# SESSION BOOTSTRAP REQUIRED

> **Any AI-assisted session MUST begin with the Architecture Bootstrap prompt.**
> **Sessions that skip this are invalid and must be discarded.**

## Quick Start

1. Open `docs/SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md`
2. Copy the bootstrap prompt
3. Paste as first message in new Claude session
4. Wait for acknowledgment before proceeding

## Why

- Claude is stateless across sessions
- Architecture governance must be explicitly loaded
- No bootstrap = no enforcement = invalid session

## Reference

- Bootstrap prompt: `docs/SESSION_BOOTSTRAP.md`
- Architecture manual: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OPERATING_MANUAL.md`
- Governance freeze: `docs/GOVERNANCE_FREEZE.md`
