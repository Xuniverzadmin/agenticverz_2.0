#   Trigger: build-time

# Role: Governed registry of attention reasons for HIL interpretation panels
# Reference: PIN-417 (HIL v1 Implementation Tracker)
#
# GOVERNANCE RULES (LOCKED):
# - Endpoint may only emit reasons present in this registry
# - Unknown reason in response => 500 (fail fast)
# - Registry changes require a PIN
# - One registry per domain (do not make global)
#
# SEMANTIC RULE:
# - A single HIL panel should not mix temporal semantics
# - This registry covers IN-FLIGHT RISK only
# - Post-fact outcomes (recent_failure) belong to separate panels
# - Governance signals (policy_violation) belong to Incidents domain

reasons:
  long_running:
    description: Run exceeds expected duration
    semantic_class: in_flight_risk
    routes_to:
      domain: Activity
      subdomain: LLM Runs
      topic: Active
      filter: long_running=true

  near_budget_threshold:
    description: Run approaching budget limit
    semantic_class: in_flight_risk
    routes_to:
      domain: Activity
      subdomain: LLM Runs
      topic: Active
      filter: near_budget_threshold=true

# Deferred reasons (DO NOT ADD HERE - separate panels)
# - recent_failure: Belongs to Completed narrative (v1.1)
# - policy_violation: Belongs to Incidents domain HIL
