notes: 'HIL v1 Incidents Summary capability.


  This is a domain-level capability that unlocks all Incidents interpretation panels.

  One capability per domain, not per panel.


  Lifecycle:

  - DECLARED: Endpoint implemented (current)

  - OBSERVED: SDSR scenario verified endpoint works

  - TRUSTED: Stable after multiple observations


  Key Invariants (enforced by SDSR scenario):

  - lifecycle_sum_reconciliation: active + acked + resolved == total

  - attention_count_matches_active: attention.count == active

  - window_echo: window echoed correctly from request

  - attention_reasons_imply_count: reasons present implies count > 0

  - provenance_present: derived_from never empty

  - aggregation_type_locked: aggregation == "STATUS_BREAKDOWN"


  To advance to OBSERVED:

  1. Run SDSR scenario: SDSR-HIL-INC-SUM-001

  2. Apply observation via AURORA_L2_apply_sdsr_observations.py

  3. Status will automatically advance to OBSERVED
