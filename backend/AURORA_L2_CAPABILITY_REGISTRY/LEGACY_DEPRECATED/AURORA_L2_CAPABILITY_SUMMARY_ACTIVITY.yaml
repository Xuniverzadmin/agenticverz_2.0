# Notes
notes: |
  HIL v1 Activity Summary capability.

  This is a domain-level capability that unlocks all Activity interpretation panels.
  One capability per domain, not per panel.

  Lifecycle:
  - DECLARED: Endpoint implemented (current)
  - OBSERVED: SDSR scenario verified endpoint works
  - TRUSTED: Stable after multiple observations

  To advance to OBSERVED:
  1. Run SDSR scenario: SDSR-HIL-ACT-SUM-001
  2. Apply observation via AURORA_L2_apply_sdsr_observations.py
  3. Status will automatically advance to OBSERVED
