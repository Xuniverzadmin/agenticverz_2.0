# LEGACY DEPRECATED CAPABILITIES
# Status: QUARANTINED - DO NOT USE
# Date: 2026-01-14
# Reference: PIN-419 (Intent Ledger Architecture)
#
# These capabilities were part of the legacy ui_plan structure that was
# superseded by the frozen UI_TOPOLOGY_TEMPLATE.yaml.
#
# They are preserved here for reference only.
# They are NOT included in compiler inputs.
# They are NOT bound to any ledger panels.
#
# To resurrect a capability:
#   1. Create a new panel entry in INTENT_LEDGER.md
#   2. Create a new capability file in the parent directory
#   3. Run SDSR scenario to observe the capability
#   4. DO NOT copy from this quarantine - re-declare intent fresh
