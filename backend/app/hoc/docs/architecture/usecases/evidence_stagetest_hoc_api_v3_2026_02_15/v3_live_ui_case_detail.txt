STATUS: BLOCKED (screenshot requires authenticated browser session)

Source-Level Proof (substitute for screenshot):

1. StagetestCaseDetail.tsx renders all 5 required table sections
2. Built JS chunk (StagetestPage-*.js) contains all 5 testids:
   - api-request-fields-table: PRESENT
   - api-response-fields-table: PRESENT
   - synthetic-input-table: PRESENT
   - produced-output-table: PRESENT
   - apis-used-table: PRESENT
3. Playwright spec test 9 asserts all testids present in source
4. Vite build succeeds (12.87 kB chunk)
5. stagetest.agenticverz.com serves the built JS (HTTP 200)

Mitigation: Open https://stagetest.agenticverz.com/fops/stagetest in authenticated browser to capture screenshot manually.
