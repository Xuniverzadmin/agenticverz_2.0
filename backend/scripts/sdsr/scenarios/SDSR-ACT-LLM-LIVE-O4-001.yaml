# SDSR Verification Scenario
# Scenario: SDSR-ACT-LLM-LIVE-O4-001
# Generated: 2026-01-15T07:31:54.205266+00:00
# Generator: aurora_sdsr_synth.py
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This scenario verifies the capability by:
#   1. Injecting an API call (cause)
#   2. Observing the response (effect)
#   3. Checking invariants (verification)
#
# EXECUTION:
#   python aurora_sdsr_runner.py --scenario SDSR-ACT-LLM-LIVE-O4-001
#
# HUMAN MAY OPTIONALLY:
#   - Add domain-specific invariants
#   - Tighten response expectations
#   - Add custom checks
#
